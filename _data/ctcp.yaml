                Extended formatting CTCPs change how messages are displayed.
                Metadata query CTCPs provide static information about the target client, user or connection.
                Extended query CTCPs provide dynamic information or invoke actions from the client.

        name: ACTION
        format: "ACTION <text>"
        ctcp-type: Extended Formatting
        spread: Universal
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#action"
        desc: >
            Displays `<text>` as an _action_ or _emote_. In clients, it's
            generally activated with the command `/me`
        examples:
            - "ACTION writes a specification"
    -
        name: AVATAR
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Specific to KVIrc
        information: "https://gist.github.com/grawity/a74722bfbfc3957684e0#avatar"
        desc: >
            Returns an URL to an "avatar" image chosen by the user.
    -
        name: CLIENTINFO
        format: "CLIENTINFO <token>{ <token>}"
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Widely implemented
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#clientinfo"
        desc: >
            Returns a list of the CTCP messages that this client supports and implements.
        examples:
            - "CLIENTINFO ACTION CLIENTINFO PING VERSION"
    -
        name: DCC
        format: "DCC <type> [varies]"
        ctcp-type: Extended Query
        spread: Widely implemented
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#dcc"
        desc: >
            Sets up and controls connections that go directly between clients,
            bypassing the IRC server. This is typically used for features that
            require a large amount of traffic between clients or simply wish to
            bypass the server itself such as file transfer, direct chat, and
            voice messages.

        name: FINGER
        format: "FINGER <info>"
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Widely implemented
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#finger"
        obsolete: true
        desc: >
            Returns miscellaneous info about the user, typically the same
            information that's in their `realname`

            However, some implementations return the client name and
            version instead.

        ctcp-type: Extended Query
        spread: Rarely implemented
        information: "https://gist.github.com/grawity/a74722bfbfc3957684e0#page"
        desc: >
            Does something to notify the recipient off-band (e.g. playing a
            sound; playing the given message via text-to-speech; etc.).
    -
        name: PING
        format: "PING <info>"
        ctcp-type: Extended Query
        spread: Universal
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#ping"
        desc: >
            Confirms reachability with other clients and checks latency.
        examples:
            - "PING 1473523721 662865"
            - "PING foo bar baz"
    -
        name: SOURCE
        format: "SOURCE <info>"
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Rarely implemented
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#source"
        desc: >
            Returns the location of the source code for the client.
        examples:
            - "SOURCE https://weechat.org/download"
    -
        name: TIME
        format: "TIME <timestring>"
        ctcp-type: Extended Query
        spread: Almost Universal
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#time"
        desc: >
            Return the client's local time in an unspecified human-readable
            format. I recommend using ISO 8601 format, but raw `ctime()` output
            appears to be the most common in practice.

            New implementations should consider using UTC time for privacy
            reasons.
        examples:
            - "TIME 2016-09-26T00:45:36Z"
    -
        name: VERSION
        format: "VERSION <verstring>"
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Universal
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#version"
        desc: >
            Return the name and version of the client software in use. There's
            no specified format for the version string.
        examples:
            - "VERSION WeeChat 1.5-rc2 (git: v1.5-rc2-1-gc1441b1) (Apr 25 2016)"
    -
        name: USERINFO
        format: "USERINFO <info>"
        ctcp-type: Metadata Query
        spread: Widely implemented
        information: "http://modern.ircdocs.horse/ctcp.html#userinfo"
        obsolete: true
        desc: >
            Returns miscellaneous info about the user, typically the same
            information that's in their `realname`

            However, some implementations return `<nickname> (<realname>)`
            instead.
