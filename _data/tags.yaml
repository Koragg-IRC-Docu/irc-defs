            The `account` tag contains the account name of the user that
            sent the attached message to the client. For instance, on a
            `PRIVMSG`, the `account` tag would contain the account name of the
            user that sent the `PRIVMSG`. Enabled by the IRCv3
            [`account-tag` capability](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-tag-3.2.html).

        examples:
            - "account=rabbit"
            - "account=george"

        comment: >
            The `batch` tag contains the ID of the batch the attached message
            is a part of. Messages that are a part of the same batch are
            related and are processed according to the IRCv3 `batch`
            specifications. Enabled by the IRCv3
            [`batch` capability](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch-3.2.html).

            The `time` tag contains the time that the given message should be
            treated as happening at. This is useful for things such as chat
            history replay. The value format is defined in the `server-time`
            specification. Enabled by the IRCv3
            [`server-time` capability](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/server-time-3.2.html).

        examples:
            - "time=2011-10-19T16:40:51.620Z"
            - "time=2012-06-30T23:59:60.419Z"
