            Notifies clients when other clients in common channels authenticate
            with or deauthenticate from their account (e.g. NickServ, SASL).

            Attaches a tag containing the user's account to every message they
            send.

        comment: >
            Notifies clients when other clients in common channels go away or
            come back (replacing the traditional method of clients polling the
            server for changes).

        name: batch

        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Lets the server bundle common messages together, which lets clients
            be more intelligent about displaying and processing them. i.e.,
            netsplits and netjoins, chat history, etc.

        comment: >
            Notifies clients when client capabilities become available or are
            no longer available.

            Implicitly enabled with `CAP LS 302` or higher.

        comment: >
            Enables the `CHGHOST` message, which lets servers notify clients
            when another client's username and/or hostname changes.

        name: echo-message
        format: "echo-message"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/echo-message-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Notifies clients when their `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE`s are correctly
            received by the server. Will be more useful for general clients
            when the IRCv3 WG standardizes their `id` tag to let clients track
            these messages properly.

        name: extended-join
        format: "extended-join"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/extended-join-3.1.html"
        comment: >
            Extends the `JOIN` message to include the account name of the
            joining client. Used in conjunction with the `account-*` caps to
            let clients track account information better.

        format: "inspircd.org/replay-message"
        comment: >
            Functionally equivalent to `echo-message`. Use `echo-message`
            rather than this capability.

        obsolete: true
        seealso: "echo-message"

        name: invite-notify
        format: "invite-notify"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/invite-notify-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Notifies clients when other clients are invited to common channels.
            The notify messages are generally only sent to privileged channel
            members.

    -
        name: metadata
        format: "metadata"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/core/metadata-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Lets clients store metadata about themselves with the server, for
            other clients to request and retrieve later.

    -
        name: monitor
        format: "monitor"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/core/monitor-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Indicates support for the `MONITOR` command, which lets users
            request notifications for when clients become online / offline.

    -
        name: multi-prefix
        format: "multi-prefix"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multi-prefix-3.1.html"
        comment: >
            Makes the server send *all* prefixes in `NAMES` and `WHO` output,
            in order of rank from highest to lowest. Replaces the `UHNAMES`
            token for `RPL_ISUPPORT`.

    -
        name: sasl
        format: "sasl[=mechanism{,mechanism}]"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Indicates support for SASL authentication, a standardized way for
            clients to identify for an account. Replaces the
            `NICKSERV IDENTIFY` command / private message and lets IRC clients
            build better interfaces for account auth.

        examples:
            - "sasl"
            - "sasl=PLAIN"
            - "sasl=EXTERNAL,FOO,DH-AES,BAR,DH-BLOWFISH,FOOBAR,PLAIN"

        name: server-time
        format: "server-time"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/server-time-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Lets clients show the actual time messages were received by the
            server. Facilitates things like IRC history playback by bouncers.

    -
        name: tls
        format: "tls"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/tls-3.1.html"
        comment: >
            Indicates support for the `STARTTLS` command, which lets clients
            upgrade their connection to use SSL/TLS rather than plaintext.

        format: "twitch.tv/commands"
        information: "https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md#commands"
        comment: >
            Used by Twitch.tv to enable the `USERSTATE`, `GLOBALSTATE`,
            `ROOMSTATE`, `HOSTTARGET`, `NOTICE`, and `CLEARCHAT` messages, as
            well as the `msg-id` tag.

        format: "twitch.tv/membership"
        information: "https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md#membership"
        comment: >
            Used by Twitch.tv to enable the `NAMES`, `JOIN`, `PART`, and `MODE`
            channel membership and state messages.

    -
        name: twitch.tv/tags
        format: "twitch.tv/tags"
        information: "https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md#tags"
        comment: >
            Used by Twitch.tv to enable custom tags on the `PRIVMSG`,
            `USERSTATE`, `NOTICE`, and `GLOBALUSERSTATE` messages.

    -
        name: userhost-in-names
        format: "userhost-in-names"
        information: "http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names-3.2.html"
        comment: >
            Extends the `RPL_NAMREPLY` message to contain the full nickmask
            `(nick!user@host)` of every user, rather than just the nickname.

        name: znc.in/self-message
        format: "znc.in/self-message"
        comment: >
            Used by ZNC to make sure all connected sessions receive copies of
            private messages sent by other sessions.
