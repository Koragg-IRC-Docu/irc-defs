# The following format is used through-out this file. The first two fields
# ('irc2char' and 'name') are mandatory, the others may or may not exist.
#
# The server_only field denotes whether or not the mode can be modified by
# a server only. If it is not set, or set to 'no', then operators can
# possibly modify them.
#
# The broadcast field specifies whether the mode is broadcast to other
# servers on the network or not.

format:
    char: mode char for irc2 based protocol(s)
    name: mode name
    origin: where the mode was found
    when: release version or announced date
    contact: point of contact associated with the mode
    information: url where to find more information
    parameter: parameter name
    comment: "comments, history etc"
    server_only: Y
    broadcast: Y
    conflict: true
    obsolete: true

values:
    -
        char: h
        name: HUB
        origin: ircu
        when: ircu2.10.11.04
        comment: >
            Indicates the server is a hub. In ircu, this also hides the
            server from users.

        server_only: Y
        broadcast: Y

    -
        char: s
        name: SERVICE
        origin: ircu
        when: ircu2.10.11.04
        comment: >
            When set, the server is a 'service' (as in, it only provides
            services). In ircu, this also hides the server from users.

        server_only: Y
        broadcast: Y
